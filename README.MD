<ins>Known Limitations</ins>:
- In-app USB Mode not supported on Adrenaline.
- The integrated Categories Lite plugin on vanilla (non-ARK) Adrenaline requires "Category prefix" to be enabled.
- The Categories Lite plugin on vanilla (non-ARK) Adrenaline and LME CFW does not merge Category folders with the same name between `/ISO` and `/PSP/GAME`.

<ins>Additional Info</ins>:
- You can disable the main screen animations by removing all the folders in the `/resources/animations` folder. (Or even add your own animation folders with animation `.png` frames named the same way as in the existing folders.)
- You can change the app background by swapping out `/resources/bkg.png`.
- A [personally-updated build of the Categories Lite plugin](https://github.com/wad11656/game-categories-lite) was created and integrated with this app to restore the functionality of hiding Categories from the XMB.

<ins>Credits</ins>:
- [CMFileManager by joel16](https://github.com/joel16/CMFileManager-PSP) was used as the base for this app to help with file operations and compiling with the modern PSP SDK.
